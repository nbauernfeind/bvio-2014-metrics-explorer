# BV IO 2014 - Hackathon - Datadog Category - Metrics Explorer

This is my entry to the BV IO 2014 Hackathon. I'm attempting to work around some short comings of datadog's metrics explorer that address ideas that I've had related to partitioning metrics.

As part of the entry, I wrote and released a burst trie implementation in scala. It can be found at http://github.com/nbauernfeind/scala-burst-trie. It's an enhanced version of what I wrote during Stripe's 3rd Capture the Flag challenge.

This is a dropwizard application; so simply run the jar, or run the main MetricsExplorerService class and head for the main index.
